# Changelog

Newest first. Releases are tags (`vX.Y.Z`).

## v0.1.1 -- 2026-10-19

- Keys are spelled out (Ctrl+Enter, Shift+Enter, Backspace) instead of symbols
  (⌃↵, ⇧↵, ⌫) in the footer and on rows and buttons.

## v0.1.0 -- 2026-10-19

- First release, as its own repository: docker containers. Replaces docker-picker.py in Vayu.
- Every container, **grouped by compose project**, running ones first, failed ones flagged.
- **Live CPU and memory** per container, and its ports.
- The preview shows the **last log lines**, and restart / stop / start / shell buttons.
- `Enter` follows the logs in a terminal; `Ctrl+T` opens a shell inside the container.
- Never wakes a stopped Docker daemon (it's often socket-activated): it says it's stopped instead.
